# Worklog: where the project stands, and the handoff between agents

Read this first, update it last. Rules for agents are in `../AGENTS.md`.

## Current state (2026-10-11)

- Branch `master`, up to date with GitHub. Version 0.1.0. Licence AGPL-3.0-only (because of the Asqatasun-derived rules).
- Checks at the last commit: `npm run check` passes (typecheck, 165 unit tests, translations 660 texts / 999 French entries,
  build); `npm run test:e2e` passes (6 browser tests: smoke, parity of every screen, review workflow at 480/768/1280 px);
  `npm run check:asqatasun`: 322 of 328 of Asqatasun's own test pages agree (73 of its 99 implemented tests ported).
- **Not yet verified in a real Firefox or in a real DevTools panel.** Everything above runs on stand-ins for the extension APIs.
  The first GitHub Actions run of `.github/workflows/ci.yml` has not been looked at.

## What exists

- **Review by element** (boxes on the page, one verdict per criterion): Images (1), Frames (2), Colours (3.2, with a
  magnifier colour picker), Tables (5), Links (6), Structure (9: headings and landmarks), Forms (11). Other themes: checklists.
- **Automatic checks** (one button): scan of all scannable themes, then axe-core (mapped rules only), own RGAA checks,
  Asqatasun-derived rules, local HTML validation (html-validate). Results are **suggestions** to confirm, with conflicts
  between tools shown. **Manual checks** (18) and **page tools** (hidden content, table structure, tab order, styles off,
  text spacing, languages), contextual to the theme.
- **Audits**: several named audits in the browser, save to / open from a `.rgaa.json` file (validated, size-bounded),
  saves through a background queue with retry. **Exports**: Excel grid (French), printable HTML report with a draft
  accessibility statement. French and English interface (French default).
- **Honesty about coverage**: rates are *provisional* while incomplete; a scan-coverage card says what was not scanned
  (iframes, shadow roots, truncation limits).
- **Quality net**: Vitest unit tests (no network), Playwright browser tests on the built panel and content script,
  golden parity tests for the content script (jsdom), parity hashes per panel screen, pinned Asqatasun fixtures, CI.
- Third parties and how to remove them: `THIRD-PARTY.md`, `NOTICE.md`. IT/legal notes: `docs/it-legal-review.en.md`, `docs/revue-it-juridique.fr.md` (they say “no data leaves the machine”: keep that true or update them).

## In progress (claimed)

Nothing claimed. Add a line here when you start something that will take more than one commit:
`- <who>: <what>, files: <...>, since <date>`

## Next (suggested order; the owner decides)

1. **Real Firefox test pass** by the owner: reload the extension, F5 on a real page, “Contrôles automatiques”; report crashes (which step, which page), the save pill, the unsaved-work dialog, the layout.
2. **Per-test results** (as Asqatasun stores them: pass / fail / need more info / not applicable per test, with the elements). Needs a data-model addition + migration; also lets the auditor confirm the Images tests the tool cannot assess (image maps, CAPTCHAs), which today leave criteria “partly covered”.
3. **Port more Asqatasun tests** (26 left: marker-based image and table tests, contrast, stylesheet test 10.4.1 — the background page could fetch stylesheets across origins).
4. **Scan inside same-origin iframes and open shadow roots** (today only reported in the coverage card; overlay, positions, snapshot and screenshots assume one document).
5. **Audit several pages in one go** (open each page of the sample, run everything), then rates per test/criterion and a comparison of two audits.
6. Smaller: keyboard shortcuts to confirm/reject a suggestion; consistency of navigation/titles across the sample (RGAA 12.x); `npm audit` reports 5 issues in dev tooling only (vitest, vite's esbuild, tinypool): fix by upgrading Vite/Vitest when convenient.

## Open decisions (owner)

- **AI**: access (copy-paste / cloud API with own key / local model / company endpoint), first tasks, what may be sent — all undecided. Principles agreed for any design: suggestions only (never a verdict), opt-in, payload shown before any call, minimal data (no cookies, no full pages, nothing from logged-in sessions), traceable (model, prompt version, date), provider-neutral, measured against the owner's own past audits before being trusted. Safe order if approved: provider interface + copy-paste mode + payload preview + stored AI suggestions; relevance judgements from text; explain-and-fix and report drafting; optional API/local; images last with consent.
- **Access42 JSON file / Stylus**: the owner will provide the file later; do not start before seeing it.
- **Project licence**: AGPL-3.0 now; removing the Asqatasun-derived code is the precondition for relicensing (`NOTICE.md`).
- **RGAA data licence** (DINUM): terms to confirm before redistributing. **Ownership/employment** of the tool if used at Banque de France: for the owner to check.

## Known limits and small issues

- Scans read the main document; content in iframes / shadow roots can be missed (reported, not scanned). Closed shadow roots and cross-origin frames cannot be read.
- `RGAA_AXE_RUN` without a `rules` list would run every axe rule (the panel always sends the list).
- Theme 3 draws a box for every contrast finding (at most 200 are listed, so bounded).
- `areas` of an image map share the box of their `<img>`.
- Two similar “personal field” regexes (`scan-elements` vs `rgaa-rules-run`) can disagree on `nom`.
- Real-Firefox behaviour is only known from the owner's tests so far (Firefox applies the page CSP to content scripts: axe is shipped patched, see `scripts/patch-axe.mjs`).

## Handoff log (newest first)

### 2026-10-11 — Claude Code — worklog and agent rules
- Did: added `AGENTS.md` (rules for any agent), `CLAUDE.md` (points to it) and this file. Before this, verified the folder: a panel
  workflow redesign and a theme-tab accessibility tweak had been made by the owner's other tool (ChatGPT pair coding); both were
  checked (`npm run check`, `npm run test:e2e`) and committed as `9a3abb8` and `197aa7b`.
- State: all checks above pass on `197aa7b`; not tried in a real Firefox.
- Next: see “Next”. Waiting on the owner for the real-Firefox report and the AI / Access42 decisions.
- For the other agent: add your entry above this one. If you edit `src/panel/**` run `npm run test:e2e` and read any parity diff before updating the baseline.

### 2026-10-10 — Claude Code (with sub-agents on isolated branches) — big build day
- Did (commits `961d251` … `e789528`): axe-core run in the page (patched to avoid `Function()` under CSP), own RGAA checks, Asqatasun port
  (73/99 tests, verified against its fixtures), page HTML capture + local validation, themes Links / Structure / Tables / Forms,
  boxes for every element, hidden-content and other page tools, report + accessibility statement draft, audit progress.
  Code review fixes: automatic evidence kept apart from confirmed verdicts, coverage-aware provisional rates, validated imports,
  serialized saves in the background, wrong-tab screenshot guard, scan-context bug, scan-coverage evidence. Refactors:
  `inject.ts` 1,621 → 109 lines (modules + typed messages), `panel.ts` 3,389 → 97 lines (modules). Tests/CI: Vitest, Playwright, pinned fixtures.
- State: everything merged on `master`, checks green; real-Firefox use found and fixed: the “undefined” URL bug, axe blocked by CSP,
  banner and scroll issues; one tab crash reported by the owner (mitigations: axe limited to mapped rules, no deep copy for the HTML snapshot, pauses between steps) — not reproduced.
- Next / For the other agent: see “Next” and “Open decisions”.
